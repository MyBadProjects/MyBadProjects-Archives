How do I get my Webhook's Discord Info?
    You can find you Webhook's Discord ID and Token in the link.
    
    The average link format looks like this: 

        https://discord.com/api/webhooks/id/token
    
    Where the ID and Token are they contain the information as labeled in the format.
    You can put the information in the 'config.ini' file in 'info/config.ini'.

How do I change the 'config.ini' file?
    You can open the 'config.ini' file in any text editor.

    When you open it, it will look like this:

        [Webhook.Settings]
        ID = 
        Token = 

        [Webhook.Timer]
        Seconds = 

    After getting your information, in the 'ID' in 'Webhook.Settings', after the '=' you put the ID. 
    This is the same for the rest of the info.

How do I get the 'Seconds' info for the Webhook?
    You get the 'Seconds' info for the Webhook by the amount of time you want between the posts.
    I recommend '300' as it is 5 minutes which seems like a good amount of time to keep any images channel active. 

    The 'Seconds' info is under [Webhook.Settings] as can be seen below.
    
        [Webhook.Timer]
        Seconds = 300

    (The shown above is my recommend settings for Webhook.Timer)
